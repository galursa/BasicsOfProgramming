Ex. 7
Write a program to compute the inverse matrix of the 2 x 2 square matrix A.
Use the formula:
   _    _                                   _       _
   | a b|                           1       | d  -b |
A= |	|	inverse of A =  --------- x |	    |					
   | c d|                        ad  - bc   |-c   a |
   -    -                                   -       - 

Ex. 8
Write a program to take two strings from user and check if they have the same first and last letters

Ex. 9
Write a program to take one string from user and to print the reverse string.

Ex. 10
Write a program to take four strings from user and to check which of them are the same. Print output.

Ex. 11
Write a program to generate a symmetrical matrix with numbers from 0 to 1. Take the size of matrix from user.
Symmetrical matrix is matrix which look like reflection of the mirror put on diagonal of the matrix. Some example:
1 2 0 1 2 0
2 2 0 2 1 1
0 0 2 0 1 0
1 2 0 1 2 0
2 1 2 2 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 1
